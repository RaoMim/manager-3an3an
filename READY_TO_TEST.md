# 🚀 Ready to Test FCM Token Flow

## ✅ **Setup Complete**

I've enhanced the manager app with automatic FCM token testing. Here's what's been added:

### 🔄 **Automatic FCM Testing on Refresh**

When you tap the **refresh button** (⟲) in the app, it will now:

1. **Display Current FCM Status**
2. **Test Token Registration with Backend**
3. **Show Detailed Logs**

### 📱 **What You'll See in Logs**

When you refresh the orders list, watch for these log messages:

```
🔄 Testing FCM token registration during refresh...

🔍 === FCM DEBUG STATUS ===
📱 FCM Token: Available (142 chars)
📨 Messaging Instance: Ready

📨 Server response received:
   📊 Status code: 200
   📄 Response body: {"Success":true,"Message":"FCM token registered successfully"}

✅ SUCCESS: FCM token sent successfully to backend
✅ FCM token registration test completed
```

## 🎯 **How to Test**

### Step 1: Start Monitoring
In one terminal, run:
```bash
flutter logs -d emulator-5554 | grep -E "(🔄|📱|🔑|📤|📨|✅|❌|🔴)"
```

### Step 2: Trigger the Test
In the manager app:
1. Go to the orders screen (should be open already)
2. Tap the **refresh button** (⟲) in the top-right corner
3. Watch the logs for the FCM token flow

### Step 3: Verify Success
Look for the final message:
```
✅ SUCCESS: FCM token sent successfully to backend
✅ FCM token registration test completed
```

## 🔍 **What This Tests**

✅ **FCM Token Generation** - Confirms token exists  
✅ **Authentication** - Uses stored auth token  
✅ **API Call** - Sends token to production endpoint  
✅ **Server Response** - Validates successful registration  
✅ **Database Storage** - Token should be saved in ManagerFCMTokens table

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

**Your app is ready for production FCM testing. Just tap the refresh button and watch the logs! 🎉**

The system will automatically:
- Extract your current auth token
- Check FCM token status  
- Send token to the backend API
- Show you the complete flow in real-time logs

No need to log in again - just use the refresh button to test the FCM token flow!
